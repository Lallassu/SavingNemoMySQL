The game is also part of Chrome Experiements: https://www.chromeexperiments.com/experiment/saving-nemo

## Description
Saving Nemo is a ThreeJS WebGL game with a NodeJS backend server to save statistics in an SQLite database.

**The code is free to use but I would appreciate if you give me credit when using it.**

*The code has NOT been polished and is provided "as is". There are a lot of code that are redundant and there are tons of improvements that can be made.*


## Testing

Install nodejs and run *"cd server; nodejs server.js"*. Then point your browser to *http://localhost:8082*

Note that you must change which server to use as the backend, default is localhost:8082. This is changed in main.js, default is localhost:8082.
